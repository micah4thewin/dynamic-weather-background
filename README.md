## dynamic-weather-background

A simple web app that shows the current weather and sets a weather-related background image using the OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs.

# How it works

The app gets the current weather information for the user's location using the OpenWeatherMap API, and then sets a background image related to the current weather using the Unsplash API. The weather information is displayed on the page as well.

# How to use it in your project

To use this app in your project, simply include the index.html, index.js, and style.css files in your project directory, along with the env.js file which contains your API keys.

You'll need to sign up for API keys for the OpenWeatherMap and Unsplash APIs, and add them to the env.js file. Make sure to keep your API keys secure!

To run the app, open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Customization

To customize the app, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to fit your needs. You can also customize the background images by modifying the search query used to get the images from the Unsplash API in the setWeatherBackground() function.

# Other information

This app was created as a simple demo project, and is not intended for production use. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects, and modify it as needed to fit your specific use case.
